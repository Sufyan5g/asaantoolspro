            <h2>The Ultimate Guide to Calculating Zakat in Pakistan (2024)</h2>
            <p>Zakat, one of the five pillars of Islam, is a mandatory act of charity that purifies the wealth of a Muslim. While the concept is simple, calculating the exact amount can often be confusing, especially with varying assets like gold, cash, and investments. This guide will walk you through the entire process step-by-step, making it easy to fulfill your religious duty accurately.</p>
            
            <h3>Step 1: Understanding Nisab - Are You Eligible to Pay Zakat?</h3>
            <p>Before you calculate Zakat, you must first determine if you are eligible to pay it. This eligibility is determined by the "Nisab" threshold. Nisab is the minimum amount of wealth a Muslim must own for a full lunar year.</p>
            <p>The Nisab can be calculated based on the value of either gold or silver:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Gold Nisab:</strong> 87.48 grams (or 7.5 tola) of gold.</li>
                <li><strong>Silver Nisab:</strong> 612.36 grams (or 52.5 tola) of silver.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Most scholars recommend using the **silver standard** for calculating Nisab because it is a lower threshold, meaning more people become eligible to pay Zakat, which benefits a larger number of poor and needy individuals. To find the current Nisab value, simply multiply the weight of silver (612.36g) by the current market rate per gram in Pakistan.</p>

            <h3>Step 2: Identify Your Zakatable Assets</h3>
            <p>Next, you need to add up all your assets that are subject to Zakat. These are assets you have owned for at least one full lunar year. The most common ones include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Cash:</strong> Money in your bank accounts, in your wallet, or at home.</li>
                <li><strong>Gold and Silver:</strong> The total value of all gold and silver you own, whether it's in the form of jewelry, coins, or bars.</li>
                <li><strong>Investments:</strong> The current market value of stocks, shares, savings certificates, and mutual funds.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Assets:</strong> The value of your business's inventory or stock-in-trade.</li>
                <li><strong>Rental Income:</strong> Any income generated from properties you have rented out.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 3: Deduct Your Liabilities (Debts)</h3>
            <p>From your total assets, you are allowed to subtract your immediate, necessary debts and expenses. These are short-term liabilities that you need to pay off, such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Utility bills (electricity, gas, internet) for the current month.</li>
                <li>Personal loans or credit card bills that are due.</li>
                <li>Rent or employee salaries that you need to pay.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Step 4: Calculate the Final Zakat Amount</h3>
            <p>Once you have your final "Zakatable Wealth" (Total Assets - Liabilities), you can calculate the Zakat. The amount of Zakat to be paid is **2.5%** of this final amount.</p>
            <p><strong>Formula:</strong> (Total Zakatable Wealth) x 0.025 = Total Zakat Payable</p>
