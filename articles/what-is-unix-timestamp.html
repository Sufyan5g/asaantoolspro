            <h2>What is a Unix Timestamp and Why Do Developers Use It?</h2>
            <p>In the world of programming, especially when dealing with servers and databases, you will frequently encounter something called a "Unix timestamp" or "Epoch time." So, what is it?</p>

            <h3>The Definition: Seconds Since the Epoch</h3>
            <p>A Unix timestamp is a very simple and clever way to represent a specific point in time. It is defined as the total number of seconds that have passed since <strong>00:00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970</strong>. This starting point is known as the "Unix Epoch."</p>
            <p>For example, a timestamp of `1720981800` represents a specific second on July 14, 2024.</p>
            
            <h3>Why is it so useful for developers?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It's Just a Number:</strong> Because it's a single integer, it's very easy to store in databases and perform mathematical calculations with (e.g., finding the difference between two times).</li>
                <li><strong>No Timezone Issues:</strong> Unix time is always based on UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). This avoids all the confusion and bugs that come from dealing with different timezones around the world.</li>
                <li><strong>Language Independent:</strong> Almost every programming language has built-in functions to handle and convert Unix timestamps.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Converting To and From Human-Readable Dates</h3>
            <p>The only downside is that a raw timestamp isn't readable for humans. That's why developers constantly need to convert it to a standard date format (like "2024-07-14 12:30:00") and vice versa.</p>
